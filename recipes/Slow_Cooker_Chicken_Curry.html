    <h1>Slow Cooker Chicken Curry</h1>

    <p> <em>This is my favorite meal to prep for the week. It's made from relatively cheap <br>
        ingredients and easy to package out into separate lunches. Serve it with rice or bread!</em></p>

        I created this recipe a while back by combining a few similar recipes that I had found on google. I had just started trying to save money and needed to lower my takeout bill by at least 75%.
        It makes enough food for about seven moderately sized meals. Serving it with rice or bread makes it last longer. The great thing about it is, you can really add whatever vegetables you like,
        and you can also spice it up to taste. Real chefs probably scoff at the idea of using a Croc Pot, but for the average person who works and tries to study in there free time, the Croc Pot has 
        become an invaluable tool for to save money and make delicious meals. I hope you enjoy this recipe. I have made it countless times and I hardly ever get sick of it. Enjoy!

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the cut-up chicken, yogurt, and a dash of salt in the bottom of your slow cooker. mix them together by hand until all the chicken is coated evenly.</li>
        <li>Heat some oil in a large pan over medium until hot and add onions. Once onions are translucent add your garlic, ginger, and spice mixture. Cook for about a minute or until spices are aromatic. Add tomato paste, cook for another minute or so and add drained can of tomatoes. Add a dash of salt, bring to simmer and pour mixture over the chicken in the slow cooker. Mix until color is consistant.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook on high for 4 hours or on low for 8 hours. At the last 20 minutes stir in cream/coconut milk. If the curry seems to thin, leave uncovered and cook for another 45 minutes while the cream settles.</li>
        <li>Now it should be ready to be served! Spoon curry over a helping of piping hot rice and add a handful of chopped cilantro on top.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
