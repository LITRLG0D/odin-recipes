# odin-recipes
    Today I am working on my first assignment from The Odin Project!
I will be using some basic HTML knowledge that I have learned to create a recipe page.
I am pretty confident in being able to finish this project pretty quickly.
A few things I plan to use are lists, headings, hyperlinks and images to ensure my page
looks appealing and easy to understand.
